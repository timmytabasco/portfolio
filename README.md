# 🌐 Portfolio – Tim Petersdorff

This repository contains the source code for my **personal developer portfolio**, built to present my work as an **upcoming software developer (Fachinformatiker für Anwendungsentwicklung)**.  
The portfolio is designed to be clean, structured, and minimal — highlighting both **technical precision** and **modern frontend aesthetics**.

## 🧠 About the Project
This portfolio was developed to serve as both a **professional presentation website** and a **technical playground**.  
It demonstrates my frontend and full-stack capabilities while keeping performance and simplicity in mind.

The design follows a soft, balanced aesthetic using **Tailwind CSS** with custom fade-in animations and dynamic UI transitions.  
Each section (Hero, About, Projects, Contact) was developed from scratch with a clear focus on **responsive layouts** and **modular code structure**.

## ⚙️ Features

### 🧭 Smooth Navigation
- Responsive navigation bar with **active section highlighting** (desktop & mobile).
- Scroll position tracking via **IntersectionObserver** to dynamically update the active menu state.

### ✨ Scroll Animations
- Custom **fade-in-on-scroll** system using IntersectionObserver.
- Supports multiple directions: up, down, left, right.
- Optional delay via `data-delay` attribute for controlled sequence animations.

### 💡 Responsive & Accessible
- Optimized for all screen sizes (mobile-first design).
- Uses Tailwind utility classes for consistent spacing, color, and typography.
- Semantic HTML structure for accessibility.

### 🪶 Minimal Dependencies
- Purely frontend-based — no heavy libraries or frameworks.
- No backend required for hosting.
- Contact form powered by **Formspree**, keeping setup minimal and secure.

### 💌 Contact Integration
- Simple **contact form** with custom toast notification upon submission.
- No backend dependency — all handled via Formspree API.
- Toast appears for 5 seconds and then fades automatically.

🧠 Fade-in Animation Logic (Custom Script)
The fade-in effect is powered by a simple but effective IntersectionObserver-based logic.
Each element with the class .fade-in (or directional variants like .fade-in-left) smoothly animates into view when entering the viewport.

js
Code kopieren
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  const fadeElements = document.querySelectorAll(".fade-in, .fade-in-left, .fade-in-right, .fade-in-down");

  const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
    entries.forEach((entry) => {
      if (entry.isIntersecting) {
        entry.target.classList.add("opacity-100", "translate-x-0", "translate-y-0");
        entry.target.classList.remove("opacity-0", "translate-y-6", "-translate-y-6", "translate-x-6", "-translate-x-6");
        observer.unobserve(entry.target);
      }
    });
  }, { threshold: 0.15 });

  fadeElements.forEach((el, i) => {
    el.classList.add("opacity-0", "transition-all", "duration-700", "ease-out");
    if (el.classList.contains("fade-in-left")) el.classList.add("-translate-x-6");
    else if (el.classList.contains("fade-in-right")) el.classList.add("translate-x-6");
    else if (el.classList.contains("fade-in-down")) el.classList.add("-translate-y-6");
    else el.classList.add("translate-y-6");

    const customDelay = el.dataset.delay;
    el.style.transitionDelay = customDelay || `${i * 150}ms`;

    observer.observe(el);
  });
});

✨ Final Note
This portfolio is not just a showcase — it’s an evolving project that grows with my skills.
I’m continuously refining both the codebase and design as I expand into full-stack and backend development.
Future updates will include additional sections for projects, technical write-ups, and case studies.
